## Project Title

Exploring the Correlation Between Net Migration Rates and Birth Rates
Overtime: A Cross-National Study

## Research Question

How do changes in net migration rates correlate with subsequent changes
in total fertility rates (TFR) within host countries over time, and what
socioeconomic factors might mediate this relationship?

##Data Source

The data used for this project was sourced from the World Bank's World
Development Indicators (WDI). The WDI provides complete cross-national
statistics on a range of development categories, compiled from
officially-recognized international sources.

## File Overview

File: world_bank_data.csv

This csv file contains data from 217 countries with the following
structure: 

- Country Name: Full name of the country 
- Country Code: ISO 3-letter country code 
- Series Name: 
   - Net migration: the net number of migrants (inflow - outflow) per year 
   - Total Fertility Rate (TFR): average number of children born per woman over her lifetime 
   - GDP per Capita (constant 2015 US\$): Real Gross Domestic Product adjusted for inflation 
   - Urban Population (% of Total): percentage of the population living in urban areas 
   - Employment to Population Ratio, 15+, Female (%) (modeled ILO estimate): the proportion of the female working-age population that is employed 
- Series Code: World Bank code for the indicator 1960 \[YR1960\] to 2024 \[YR2024\]: Annual data from each year (1960 to 2024)

Each country appears five times in the data set, once for each series category
